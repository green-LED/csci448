Built in Android Studio

You should be able to run the game from it using an emulator or a connected Android device

The game consists of a ship that constantly shoots up. You can
 move the ship on the x-axis by pressing down/dragging anywhere.
 Pressing above or below the ship changes the nature of the
 bullets it shoots. Enemies spawn at random time intervals from
 random points on the top of the screen and travel down at random
 speeds. The speed and frequency of enemies increases over time.
 The bullets fired by the player ship remove enemies on contact.

The proposal promised a menu that could be pulled up and flicked
 to select a weapon, but I had trouble making such an interface,
 so opted for a simpler control scheme.
